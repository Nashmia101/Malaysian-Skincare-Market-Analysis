## Project Overview

This project examines consumer behavior in the Malaysian skincare industry by analyzing the relationship between consumer demand, product features, and market supply. By integrating survey-based consumer insights with product availability data, the analysis identifies areas where the market aligns with — or fails to meet — consumer needs.

The objective is to transform raw data into actionable insights that support informed decision-making for businesses, researchers, and consumers.



## Problem Statement

The skincare industry is highly consumer-driven, yet mismatches frequently exist between consumer preferences and available products.

This project investigates:

- Whether popular product features are adequately represented in the market  
- Which skincare categories are oversupplied or underserved  
- How demographic factors influence purchasing behavior  
- Where companies can better align product strategies with consumer priorities  

Understanding these dynamics is essential for improving product development, reducing inefficiencies, and enhancing customer satisfaction.



## Datasets

The dashboard integrates two complementary datasets representing both sides of the market.

### Malaysian Skincare Survey (Demand Side)
Captures consumer preferences, demographics, skin concerns, and purchasing behavior.

### Cosmetics Dataset (Supply Side)
Contains product attributes, ingredient flags, brand distribution, and category availability.

## Data Preparation

Both datasets were cleaned and standardized to enable meaningful comparison:

- Removed incomplete and irrelevant records  
- Standardized feature labels such as alcohol-free and fragrance-free  
- Unified product categories  
- Normalized categorical responses  
- Prepared datasets for cross-market comparison  

These steps ensured analytical consistency when evaluating demand–supply gaps.



## Key Insights

The analysis reveals several important market dynamics:

- Consumer demand for alcohol-free products exceeds current supply, indicating a potential opportunity for expansion.  
- Petroleum-free products dominate supply but do not demonstrate proportionate consumer demand, suggesting possible oversupply.  
- Cleansers and moisturizers account for the majority of available products, while categories such as eye care remain relatively niche.  
- Women show significantly higher engagement and purchasing frequency in skincare compared to men.  
- Sensitive skin is most prevalent among younger consumers, while combination skin becomes more common in older groups.

Together, these findings highlight opportunities for stronger alignment between consumer expectations and market offerings.



## Visualization Design

Multiple visualization techniques were used to enhance interpretability and support structured visual analysis:

- Donut charts comparing demand and supply for product features  
- Tree maps illustrating supply distribution across categories  
- Stacked bar charts revealing skin concerns by age group and purchasing patterns  
- Grouped bar charts comparing feature availability across product types  
- Dumbbell plots highlighting demand–supply gaps  
- Bubble charts showing brand concentration within categories  
- Line charts examining purchase frequency by gender  

Interactive filters allow users to explore insights by demographic segments such as age and gender.



## Tools and Skills Demonstrated

- Data Visualization using Tableau  
- Consumer Behavior Analysis  
- Market Gap Identification  
- Data Cleaning and Normalization  
- Cross-Dataset Integration  
- Insight Communication  
- Business-Oriented Analytics  



## Project Relevance

This project demonstrates how data analytics can bridge the gap between consumer expectations and business strategy. The insights can support skincare companies in refining product portfolios, help product developers prioritize high-demand features, and assist researchers in understanding evolving consumer trends.

More broadly, the analysis reflects the importance of aligning supply with demand in competitive, consumer-centric industries.



## Future Enhancements

Potential extensions of this work include:

- Predictive modeling to forecast product demand  
- Consumer segmentation using clustering techniques  
- Price sensitivity analysis  
- Recommendation systems for personalized skincare  
- Time-series analysis of evolving consumer preferences  

These directions would further strengthen data-driven decision-making within the beauty industry.
